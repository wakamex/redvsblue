# Unfetchable Sources (Need Manual Help)

As of **2026-02-09**, there are **no outstanding blocked sources** in this repo.

If we add new URLs and fetching fails in this environment (WAF / bot protection / access restrictions / broken links), list them here and (if you can) provide either the PDF/text or an alternate accessible URL so we can add them to `literature/`.
