  v1 metric registry for the initial D-vs-R scoreboard. This file defines:
  (1) base series pulled from online sources, and (2) derived metrics and
  term-level aggregations.

  Notes:
  - All percent units are in "percentage points" unless otherwise stated.
  - For growth/return metrics, we prefer log-diff annualization unless noted.
  - Term attribution (e.g., inauguration lag) is configured elsewhere; this file
    only specifies metric definitions.
