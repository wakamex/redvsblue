# Metrics Coverage Matrix (v1)

This file records judgment calls for which transforms we include per source series.
It is designed to reduce hidden opinion and make "why not this metric?" auditable.

## Coverage Policy (Unopinionated Default)

Default stance: include a broad transform set unless a transform is clearly non-interpretable for that series type.

Series-type defaults:

- Level/index series (GDP, prices, wages, stock levels):
  - Prefer: `mean` (where meaningful), `end_minus_start`, `end_minus_start_per_year`, `pct_change_from_levels`, `cagr_from_levels`.
  - Optional: short-horizon growth transforms (MoM/QoQ/YoY) when they are standard for that domain.
- Rate series already in percent (e.g., unemployment rate, debt-to-GDP):
  - Prefer: `mean`, `last`, `end_minus_start`, `end_minus_start_per_year`.
  - Avoid percent-change-on-percent-rate transforms unless specifically justified.
- Return series:
  - Prefer: annualized compound return, term-total compound return, volatility, Sharpe.
- Binary indicator series:
  - Prefer: share/time-in-state (`mean`), transition counts (`count_transitions`).

## Current v1 Coverage Review

Legend:
- `covered`: transform class is represented in `spec/metrics_v1.yaml`.
- `partial`: some analogous transforms exist, but not a full symmetric set.
- `intentionally_omitted`: excluded for interpretability or data-definition reasons.
- `candidate`: reasonable addition for a later spec version.

### Output

- `gdpc1_real_gdp`
  - `covered`: QoQ annualized growth mean, term total percent change, term CAGR.
- `a939rx0q048sbea_real_gdp_per_capita`
  - `covered`: QoQ annualized growth mean, term total percent change, term CAGR.

### Labor

- `payems_payroll_employment`, `ce16ov_household_employment`
  - `covered`: total change, per-year change, term percent change, term CAGR.
- `unrate_unemployment_rate`
  - `covered`: mean, end-of-term value, pp change, pp change per year.
  - `intentionally_omitted`: percent-change transform on unemployment rate (not policy-intuitive).

### Wages

- `les1252881600q_real_median_weekly_earnings`
  - `covered`: mean, end-of-term value, term percent change, term CAGR.

### Prices / Inflation

- `cpiaucns_cpi_unadjusted`
  - `covered`: YoY mean, term percent change, term CAGR.
- `cpiaucsl_cpi`
  - `covered`: YoY mean (alternate), MoM annualized log-diff mean.
  - `partial`: no term total/CAGR level metrics for SA CPI.
  - `intentionally_omitted`: SA level-term metrics not primary because SA revisions can complicate historical reproducibility.
- `pcepi_pce_price_index`
  - `covered`: YoY mean, MoM annualized log-diff mean, term percent change, term CAGR.

### Finance

- `ff_factors_monthly` (`mkt_rf`, `mkt_total`)
  - `covered`: annualized returns, excess/total term-total returns, volatility, Sharpe.
- `sp500_sp500_index`, `djia_dow_jones`
  - `covered`: term percent change and CAGR.
- `sp500_spx_backfilled_pre1957`
  - `covered`: separate historical-composite term percent change and CAGR.
  - `intentionally_omitted`: stitched modern+historical headline series.

### Recessions

- `usrec_recession_indicator`
  - `covered`: recession month share, recession start count.
  - `intentionally_omitted`: "severity" metrics from `USREC` alone (not identifiable from a binary indicator).

### Fiscal

- `gfdegdq188s_federal_debt_pct_gdp`
  - `covered`: mean, end, pp change, pp change per year.
- `fyfsgda188s_federal_surplus_deficit_pct_gdp`
  - `covered`: mean, end, pp change, pp change per year.

## Suggested v2 Additions (Priority Order)

1. Decide whether SA CPI level-term percent/CAGR variants should be added as explicit alternates.
2. Consider a strict "primary metric per family" registry field in spec to lock publication defaults.
3. Add a lightweight automated coverage check that fails CI if a series loses transform symmetry unintentionally.

## Change-Control Rule

If we reject a candidate transform, record:
- reason for exclusion,
- expected bias if excluded,
- and where the alternate evidence is represented.

This avoids silent opinionated pruning.
