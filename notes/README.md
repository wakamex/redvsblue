# Notes

This directory stores durable project notes that are not generated artifacts.

- Use this for methodological rationale, interim interpretations, and decision logs.
- Keep raw/source-specific reading notes in `literature/<slug>/notes.md`.
- Keep schema/metric definitions in `spec/`.
- Keep generated outputs in `reports/` (gitignored).

Current files:

- `notes/analysis_rationale_and_findings.md`: Rationale for the current analysis framing and interim findings from the Congress-control checks.
