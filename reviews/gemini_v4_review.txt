This is a sophisticated, professionally structured repository. For a project aimed at the intersection of political rhetoric and macroeconomic data—an area usually fraught with "p-hacking" and selective windowing—this architecture is remarkably disciplined.

You haven't just built a script; you've built a **research harness**. The analytical rigor reflects the kind of scrutiny found in professional coverage universes, where inherited conditions and global shocks often mask underlying performance.

Here is the review based on your four core criteria:

### 1. Clean & Minimal

The repository is exceptionally "clean." The use of `uv` for dependency management and Python 3.13 indicates a modern, streamlined environment.

* **Modular Separation:** Moving data fetching into `rb/sources/` and using atomic caching prevents the "spaghetti code" that usually plagues data science repos.
* **Declarative Metrics:** Placing metric definitions in `spec/*.yaml` is the highlights of this repo. It separates the **policy** of the analysis from the **engine** of the code.
* **CLAUDE.md:** Having a dedicated "context" file for AI-assisted development is a pro-tier move that ensures the pipeline logic remains consistent during long-running refinement sessions.

### 2. Robust

The robustness here is statistical rather than just "code-stable."

* **Inference Strategy:** Using permutation-based inference is the correct choice given the small  (23–51 terms). It avoids the pitfalls of assuming a normal distribution in a non-normal historical sample.
* **FDR Correction:** Applying Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) correction across all 83 metrics is a high bar for honesty. Most "popular" analyses would simply report the 5–10 "significant" p-values and ignore the look-ahead bias; your pipeline forces you to see the "noise" for what it is.
* **Validation Step:** The `rb validate` command as a distinct pipeline step is vital for ensuring that data joins (always the weakest link in time-series) aren't hallucinating growth.

### 3. Unopinionated

This is where the repo truly succeeds. You have moved the "opinion" from the code to the **literature**.

* **The Literature Corpus:** By documenting "Methodological Fault Lines" in `literature/REVIEW.md`, you acknowledge the subjectivity of "lags" and "attribution windows" before a single line of math is run.
* **Parameterization:** Defaulting to unrestricted permutation while allowing `--term-block-years` for sensitivity analysis allows users to "choose their own adventure" without the code forcing a narrative.
* **The "Honest" Result:** Your README's bottom line—that only one metric (unemployment change) survives the FDR correction—is a testament to an unopinionated design. A biased repo would have adjusted the window until GDP growth hit the  threshold.

### 4. Economic Analysis Quality

The pipeline addresses the "identification limit" (the fact that presidents don't control the weather or oil prices) better than 90% of the infographics on social media.

| Feature | Impact on Analysis |
| --- | --- |
| **Atomic Caching** | Ensures reproducibility; the "FRED" data you see today is the same one you'll see in six months. |
| **Randomization Module** | Quantifies "luck" vs. "performance" via null distribution generation. |
| **Manifest.json** | Creates a traceable audit trail from raw PDF to extraction to notes. |

### Constructive Critiques & Suggestions

* **Testing Coverage:** While you have `rb validate` for data sanity, I don't see a `tests/` directory for the internal logic of `metrics.py` or `randomization.py`. Since your conclusions rest on the permutation logic, a few unit tests for your  and  calculation functions would be a good addition.
* **Visualization:** The "Scoreboard" is Markdown. For 83 metrics, a Markdown table becomes a wall of text. You might consider an optional `rb plot` command using a library like Plotly or even just a simple Sparkline generator to show the "Distribution of Gaps" across the permutations.
* **Exogenous Shocks:** Your `literature/REVIEW.md` mentions "Shock decomposition." Integrating a "Global Growth" or "Oil Price" covariate into the `spec/` would be the final boss of making this "unopinionated."

### Verdict

**Does it achieve the goal?** Yes. It is a rare example of a political data project that prioritizes **statistical truth** over **narrative satisfaction**.

Would you like me to help you draft a `pytest` suite for the `randomization.py` module to ensure the FDR correction logic is mathematically sound?
